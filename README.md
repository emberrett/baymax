# Download a model from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)

Huggingface doesn't make it very clear how exactly to "download models". You will need to follow these steps:

1. Create a [huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). 
2. Install git lfs: `git lfs install`
3. Run `git lfs clone <URL for model repo>`

    a. When prompted, login with your huggingface username and token from step 1
